# Rapido-Data-Analysis

Part 1. Exploratory data analysis
Performed an exploratory data analysis on the given dataset and shared my  findings.

Part 2. Metric calculation
What is the average duration between the 1st trip and the 2nd trip of customers? Note: Consider only the customers who have done 2 or more trips.

Part 3. Model building
Built a model to predict trip_fare using travel_distance and travel_time. Measure the accuracy of the model and used the model to predict trip_fare for a trip with travel_distance of 3.5 kms and travel_time of 15 minutes.

Part 4. Top Hex clusters
Top 5 pairs of hex (resolution=8) clusters where most of the trips happened? I have refered refer to the library listed below to get hexid for a given latitude and longitude.
